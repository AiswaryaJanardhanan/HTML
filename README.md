#"HTML Project for Beginners"

This repository shares the code for learning basics of HTNML step by step and built a simple website by just using HTMl.

Directions:
First revise through lessons 1 to 7. Then without checking the html files of lesson 8 try to buld the website as shown in the examples of Sample Website. 
There are images of the 3 web pages you need to build in the examples folder. Use them as references for what you build.

You should name your files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link that file to your HTML files.

All images are provided in the img folder.

If you need to find taco emojis, try Emojipedia.

A favicon is already included. You'll need to add it in the head section of each page.
